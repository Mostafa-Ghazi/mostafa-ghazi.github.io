## Research Interests

My research focuses on artificial intelligence with interests in deep machine learning and computer vision methods that are robust, generalizable, and applicable to real-world data. 

### 1. Deep Generative Models for Images
- Generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and denoising diffusion models  
- Bias mitigation, fairness, privacy, and quality assessment  

### 2. Robust Representation Learning
- Unsupervised, self-supervised, and active learning
- Transfer learning, domain adaptation, and data augmentation
- Multimodal, heterogeneous, and time-series data  

### 3. Brain Health Data Analysis
- Disease progression modeling and prediction
- Alzheimerâ€™s disease, stroke, tumors, psychiatric disorders
